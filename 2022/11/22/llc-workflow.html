    <p>The semester is winding down and so is my time as a remote metadata intern for the Law Library of Congress.  I ended up learning a ton about Unix text processing workhorses like aspell, awk, diff, find, grep, sed, and GNU Emacs as well as newer tools like <a href="https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miller</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Datasette</a>.  I incorporated these tools into several shell scripts to expedite my workflow, which is built around a python script I wrote to extract specific text from the PDF I was working with using regular expressions.  I also did a fair amount of work with Google Sheets and SQLite, and towards the end of the internship I even dabbled with the Google Drive API.</p>

<p>My plan now is to write a series of posts detailing the steps in this workflow and my use of the tools mentioned above.  Below is a high-level overview of my workflow as it stands towards the end of the semester.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract text with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prep.sh</code> script.</li>
  <li>Paste initial metadata into Google Sheets.
    <ul>
      <li>This initial metadata comes from running the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mlr --c2t --headerless-csv-output cat 74_2_{PAGE_NUM}.csv | pbcopy</code>.</li>
      <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">74_2_{PAGE_NUM}.csv</code> is one of the files generated by the the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prep.sh</code> script.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Review each of the text files generated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prep.sh</code> (this includes running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aspell</code>).</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cleanup.sh</code> to delete backup files, move the working directory to its final location, and copy the names of the text files to the clipboard for pasting into Google Sheets.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update_tsv_data.sh</code> to create local copies of the metadata, load the metadata and text files into a SQLite database, and publish that database to Heroku.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stay tuned for more posts about each of the above steps, starting with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prep.sh</code> script.</p>
