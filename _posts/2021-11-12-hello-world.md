Inspired by [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelpanik_real-simple-you-cannot-get-a-job-as-a-web-activity-6864304502825095168-kES8), I decided I needed to (re)build myself a presence on the web. Right now, I'm taking it as an opportunity to acquaint myself with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, though in the future I may use this space to experiment with other technologies.

On the blog, I hope to post about what I'm learning in [library school](https://slis.ua.edu/) and other interesting (to me) tidbits I pick up from my programming self study. I'm currently focusing on working through [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/), but I've got my fingers in several other pies as well. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/blackerby) for a record of my interests and experiments.
