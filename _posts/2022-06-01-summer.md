I am treating today as my real first day of summer. I submitted grades yesterday and would have been a bit more celebratory before today had I not contracted Covid chaperoning a school event a little while ago. I am happily on the mend now, though, and am ready to dedicate myself to some projects that are tough to get involved in during the school year.

This post will be somewhat short, but I'd like to enumerate some goals for the summer in it:

- learn at least three math skills every day on the EdX College Algebra course I've been taking.
- cover a chapter per day in the React tutorial I'm following.
- complete one online banjo lesson per day.
- publish a post on this blog at least weekly.

I may add to this list, but I think this is an aggressive start. I've got some goals I set in previous posts I need to catch up on, too. More to come!
