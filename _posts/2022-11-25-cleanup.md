With the text files edited, it's time to clean up a little bit.  That's what `cleanup.sh` is for.

As usual, we start with the shebang line.
```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
```

We remove all of the no longer necessary backups. The `-f` makes sure there are no complaints in case no backups exist.
```zsh
# remove temporary files 
rm -f *.bak
rm -f *~
```

This section isn't really necessary, but I added in to make working with one-off `awk` commands a little easier (tabs as delimiters are much easier to deal with than commas).
```zsh
# tsv file for easier command line text processing
filepath=`realpath *.csv`
dirname=`dirname $filepath`
basename=`basename $filepath '.csv'`
mlr --c2t cut -o -f bill_type,bill_number,sponsor,action_date,committee $filepath > "$dirname/$basename.tsv"
echo "Created $dirname/$basename.tsv"
```
[Miller](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) really shines here.  `awk` could do the same thing, but with Miller I can use the names of the columns.  In `awk`, I'd have to remember which numeric field variable, e.g., `$1` corresponds to which column.

Here, we add the names of all the text files in the directory to the clipboard for pasting into the spreadsheet.
```zsh
ls *.txt | pbcopy
echo "Filenames copied to clipboard."
```

Now it's time to get rid of the backup directory created by `prep.sh` if it exists.
```zsh
PWD=$(pwd)
if [[ -d "${PWD}.bak" ]]
then
	rm -rf "${PWD}.bak"
	echo "Backup removed."
fi
```


Finally, we move the directory up to its final location on my hard drive.
```zsh
mv $PWD $(dirname $(dirname $PWD))
echo "${PWD} moved."
cd ..
```

# Up next
Now it's time for a little data munging with the script `update-tsv-data.sh`.
