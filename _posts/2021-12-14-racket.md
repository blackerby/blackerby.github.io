I've got about 21 exercises left in [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org) and have read (though not understood) all of [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition). As such, I've been scattering my attention among some potential next steps in my Lisp self-education. This post serves to gather them in one place.

* I've made it up to the 9th section of [Continue: Web Applications in Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.Breaking_.Up_the_.Display%29).
* I've made it up to section [3.8 Pairs and Lists](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pairs.html) in the [Racket Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/).
* I've followed the first four tutorials of [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/#tutorials). Next up is [Extend a data format: jsonic](https://beautifulracket.com/jsonic/intro.html).
* And I've dipped my toe in [Programming Languages Application and Interpretation](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/index.html). I'll pick up again from [Everything (We Will Say) About Parsing](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/Everything__We_Will_Say__About_Parsing.html).

I've also come across some textbook titles from the 80s that use Scheme to introduce computer science. These are:

* [Concrete Abstractions](https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/concrete-abstractions.html)
* [Simply Scheme](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html)
* [Scheme and the Art of Programming](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~williams/cs357/springer-friedman.pdf)
  * Solutions to exercises from the first seven chapters are [here](http://playpen.sixbit.org/studies/aop/).

Now, time to make a decision on where to go next and stick with it.
