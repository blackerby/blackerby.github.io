As I said in my last post, one of my goals this summer us to publish a blog post every week. I had forgotten about that goal until I looked at my todo list for the day and surprised myself that I'd had the presence of mind to set up a weekly reminder for this goal. So, this will be a short post, but it counts.

On Monday I plan to submit an application for an [internship in the Remote Metadata Program with the Law Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/internships/remote-metadata-internship-unpaid/). I have spent some of this past week working on my resume and cover letter and am grateful for Dr. MacCall for his feedback on both. I decided to start keeping my resume in a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file in a git repository so I could have an easily manipulable text-based format to prepare it in and so I could keep up with different versions and changes over time. A rather lofty goal I had was to learn to use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert the file to PDF, but I didn't have the patience to learn how to change the default TeX-based formatting of the PDF file it outputs. Pandoc will have to wait.

A little bit of digging for another Markdown-to-PDF solution that doesn't involve uploading my document to a remote site turned up a nifty little [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) tool called [md-to-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md-to-pdf). The documentation is great and the tool is pretty intuitive to use if you're comfortable on the command line. I am really pleased with how the resulting PDF looks (after a little tweaking). Plus, since I've been working on learning Javascript and React, it seems like a tool that might be to try to dig into the internals of.
