In my [last post](https://blackerby.github.io/2021/12/14/racket.html), I said

> I've been scattering my attention among some potential next steps in my Lisp self-education.

Since then, that scattering has only increased. I sprung for a hard copy of [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). Soon after, I began facing the reality of my mathematical immaturity. I used [Concrete Abstractions](https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/concrete-abstractions.html) to begin filling in some of those gaps, along with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), the [Stitz-Zeager books](https://www.stitz-zeager.com) and, eventually, a copy of [Calculus Made Easy](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466866355/calculusmadeeasy). I considered treating [Brian Harvey](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/) as the Vergil to my Dante (not that SICP is Hell; maybe Purgatory?) thanks to the great plan found [here](https://github.com/alebricio/cs61a). Meanwhile, I continued my self-education in formal logic, spurred by an interest in formal semantics, again scattering my attention. And then my second semester at [SLIS](https://slis.ua.edu) began.

The coursework has been more engaging this semester than last semester, focusing, so far, on Information Science and Linked Data (nothing like reading [a paper](https://www.jlis.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/375) with extensive quotes in French and Italian and references to both Umberto Eco and Alan Turing to get the blood flowing). This means, perhaps fortunately, less time for self-study (read: attention scattering). But, because in reading the [RDF specification documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#section-Introduction) I've discovered the authors' backgrounds in what I will somewhat ignorantly call classical AI, I think it will be worthwhile to continue studying logic on my own. Perhaps more on this in a future post.

So, the plan, in short, is this: while doing all the reading for my courses I will
- continue studying logic and semantics
- continue studying math
- save my study of SICP for this summer, ideally with increased mathematical capability and perhaps still using [Harvey's Spring 2011 CS61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61as/sp11/) as a guide.
