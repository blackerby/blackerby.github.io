I am an inexperienced shell scripter, but this project provided opportunities to do some productive work with the shell.  My workflow starts with running `prep.sh`, a script that takes 2 or 3 arguments and is explained below.

# Shebang
I'm on macOS, so my shebang line references zsh.
```zsh
#! /usr/bin/env zsh
```

# Arguments
```zsh
FILE=$(realpath $1) # full path to file name. must be pdf
START=$2 # starting page of pdf file
if [[ -n $3 ]]
then
	FINISH=$3 # ending page of pdf file
fi
```
Here, I use `realpath` to take an argument like `../../74.2.pdf` and expand it to its full path.  The first argument, `$1`, is should be a path to a PDF file.  `$2` should be the page the python script begins processing from, and `$3` should be the last page it processes.

# Processing
```zsh
# pull metadata into csv and write summaries out to text files
# named following this schema: {congress}_{session}_{bill type}_{bill number}.txt
if [[ -n $FINISH ]]
then
	python3 get_summaries.py $FILE $START $FINISH
else
	python3 get_summaries.py $FILE $START
fi
```
If there is no `$3`, no worries: we just pass the file path and the start page to the python script.

```zsh
# get file's name for name of new directory and iteration purposes
FILE_BASENAME=$(basename $FILE .pdf) 
```
Here, I use `basename` with the name of the file and the extension `.pdf` to get the basename of the file the script is processing.  This will be used to name the directories created by the script.

```zsh
# make new directory and move generated files into it
if [[ -n $FINISH ]]
then
	NEW_DIR="${FILE_BASENAME}_${START}_${FINISH}"
else
	NEW_DIR="${FILE_BASENAME}_${START}"
fi
```
Above, we name the directory that the files generated by the script will be moved into.

Manual processing of the bill summaries pointed out some common OCR errors, so below I run a `sed` script to deal with some of those.
```zsh
for f in *.{txt,csv}
do
	gsed -f common_errors.sed -i $f
done
```

Here's what that script looks like:
```sed
s/\bJudiciarv\b/Judiciary/ig
s/\bTvdings\b/Tydings/g
s/\bbv\b/by/g
s/\banv\b/any/g
s/\bdenved\b/derived/g
s/\bm\b/in/g
s/\bpiopose\b/propose/g
s/\bwhioh\b/which/g
s/\beto.\b/etc./g
s/\bwit inn\b/within/g
s/\bwrorks\b/works/g
s/\bLnited\b/United/g
s/\bsolelv\b/solely/g
s/\blavs\b/lays/g
s/\bArmv\b/Army/g
s/\biniured\b/injured/g
s/\bDedares\b/Declares/ig
s/\bcrcp\b/crop/ig
s/\bWilev\b/Wiley/ig
s/\bdomestio\b/domestic/ig
```
Simple stuff, but it saves some time.

The OCR preserved the typesetting of the lines in the original document, so I run another `sed` script to make the lines flow and to replace some of the entities the script brings in and normalize some of the punctuation.
```zsh
for f in *.txt
do
	gsed -i.bak -Ez -f clean_lines.sed $f
done
```

Here's that script:
```sed
s/- \n//g
s/(\.:) \n/\1\n\n/g
s/([^.:] )\n/\1/g
s/(‘‘|’’|“|”)/"/g
s/[‘’]/'/g
s/-?— ?/--/g
s/■//g
s/ (#|\.+) / /g
s/(\w\.)\.+/\1./g
```

# Wrapping up
Finally, I move the files generated by the python script into a directory named after the file and page number(s) the being procssed and then copy that directory and its contents into a backup directory.
```zsh
mkdir $NEW_DIR
mv $FILE_BASENAME*.??? $NEW_DIR
cp -R $NEW_DIR "${NEW_DIR}.bak"
```

# Pasting metadata
The data entry for this workflow happens in Google Sheets, so I use [Miller](https://miller.readthedocs.io) to convert the generated CSV file to TSV for easier pasting into Sheets.  I could probably go back and have the script spit out TSV instead of CSV.
```zsh
mlr --c2t --headerless-csv-output cat 74_2_{PAGE_NUM}.csv | pbcopy
```
`--c2t` tells Miller to convert CSV to TSV, and `--headerless-csv-output` ignores the first line of the file.

# Up next
As you can probably tell, this script is really just a harness for the `get_summaries.py` script that does the bulk of the work.  That script will be explained in the next post.
